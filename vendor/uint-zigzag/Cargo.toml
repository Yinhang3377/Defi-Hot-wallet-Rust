description = """
Uint is a convenience wrapper for zig-zag encoding integers to byte sequences.

This allows better compression since the majority of numbers are quite small resulting
in 1 or 2 bytes in the most common case vs 4 for 32-bit numbers or 8 for 64-bit numbers.

This also permits the user to not have to think about which integer type is the most efficient to compress.
